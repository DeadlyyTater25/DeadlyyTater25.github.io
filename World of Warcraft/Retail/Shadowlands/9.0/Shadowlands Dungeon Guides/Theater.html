      <h1> Introduction to: The Theater of Pain</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> The first Maldraxous dungeon, and one of my favorite sets of fights.
	  However, if you do not have a good tank and healer you will not win these fights.</p>
	  <h1> First Boss: Affront of Challengers</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> This boss is one of the more annoying shadowlands bosses, it is a gauntlet fight meaning you have to deal with three bosses at once.
	  You need to pick a kill order, each one enrages at 40 percent health becoming more damgerous so DO NOT try and kill them at the same time unless you have insane DPS in your group.
	  The kill order will depend on your party composition and your availability of dispells for enemy benefitical buffs, and cure spells.
	  You need to make sure if possible you remove spectral transference and cure genetic alteration. In addition, you will have a 4th threat to contend with who needs to be CCed.</p>
	  <h1> Second Boss: Gorechop</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> This is more or less your standard boss fight. Watch your feet, dodge attacks, and avoid killing adds in the wrong spot to keep the floor as clear as possible.
	  There is nothing special here, just a quick clean victory.
	  <h1> Third Boss: Xav</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">This boss is a fun one. You want to dodge normal attacks, and his telegraphed might of maldraxous combo, focus banners when they are up,
	  and you want to decide who kills who in pvp so you can have the dps buff after they come back to the main fight.</p>
	  <h1> Fourth Boss: Kul'Tharok</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> This boss will rip out your soul and stun you, as soon as you can you must run and touch it in order to be able to cast and attack again.
	  Other than that dodge attacks watch your feet, and spread out during phantasmal parasite until the healer can dispel it.</p>
	  <h1> Fifth Boss: Mordretha</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> This boss has a pull mechanic that needs to be fought against, of course it would not be a final boss without a rotating death beam you have to avoid,
	  you need to avoid the ghosts as they fight each other and charge in, and lastly of course dont forget to interrupt and kill all other adds asap.</p>
