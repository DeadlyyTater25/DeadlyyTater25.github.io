      <h1> Introduction to: The Mists of Tirna Scithe</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">The second dungeon in Ardenweald, and in my opinion the most fun dungeon in the game, is extremely easy. There really isn't much more to say about this dungeon so let's get right to the bosses.</p>
	  <h1> First Boss: Ingra Maloch and Droman</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">The fight is simple in fact it does not even necessarily need a long drawn out explanation. Simply interrupt spirit bolt, suck it up during the fear, and avoid droman's cone and tears of the forest.
	  You want to focus Droman as once he reaches 20% health he stuns Ingra Maloch for 12 seconds and makes him take 200% more damage. Use your big cooldowns here and repeat. Easy Peasy win.</p>
	  <h1> Second Boss: Mistcaller</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">Mistcaller will use dodgeball sending out blue orbs that must be dodged. One player will be targetted with pattycake which they must interrupt,
	  if the player does not have an interrupt....too bad. Freeze tag will fixate a random player they should run to avoid damage and an AOE freezing them and everyone close die 8 seconds.
	  Guessing Game will occur every 30% of health and leave the players to kill the correct (Different) clone as constant raid damage is being emitted if the wrong clone is killed it explodes so choose wisely.
	  Rinse and repeat to beat the boss and clear the mist from the forest.</p>
	  <h1> Third Boss: Tred'ova</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> the final boss is your standard boss type stuff, avoid swirls and pools dps the boss, dps off consumption shield then kick the cast, finally interrupt fester.
	  Make sure to CC and kill the adds as they spawn and that is the fight.</p>
