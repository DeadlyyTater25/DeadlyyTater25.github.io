      <h1> Introduction to: Plaguefall</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> any easy dungeon with a couple of pretty rough dps checks, shouldn't be too difficult for most experienced players however.</p>
	  <h1> First Boss: Globgrog</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> Stay close to Globgrog to avoid being knocked into the slime, try to side step slimewave (I kmow this is easier said than done for slow classes),
	  and CC the slime he summons to kill them. If you dont he heals and its a bad time so dont mess that up. That's it a quick clean fight as long as your party kills the slimes. </p>
	  <h1> Second Boss: Doctor Ickus</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">This boss is nothing but a dps check plain and simple. The boss will leap from platform to platform as you follow him around. Healers should as always dispell the debuff,
	  Tank needs to stop small exploding slime by stepping on them, all players should focus the big slime bomb lest you wipe you only have about 30 seconds to kill it.
	  If your dps isnt high enough or people act stupid, you will not finish this boss.
	  <h1> Third Boss: Domina Venomblade</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> The most important part of this fight is to group up with a buddy. When you get the shadow ambush ring you need to move when it goes off then group back up, use AOE to kill the add,
	  and dps the boss. That is the entire fight.</p>
	  <h1> Fourth Boss: Margrave Stradama</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> This boss is all about dodging well telegraphed attacks. One person needs to soak the ring left by the add, dodge the tentacles, and healers should cure diseases as quick as they can.
	  This is the fight dodge smashes and pools and kill the boss.</p>
