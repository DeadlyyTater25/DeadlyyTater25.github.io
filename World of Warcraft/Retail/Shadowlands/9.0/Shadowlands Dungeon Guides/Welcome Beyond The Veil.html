      <h1> Welcome Beyond The Veil </h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> With Shadowlands officially released it is time to take a quick dive into each of the eight brand new dungeons and their boss fights.
	  While not quite as large as a raid guide, each of these smaller guides should provide you with enough knowledge to tackle these fun group activites on mythic difficulty and beyond.
	  I will not be going over the differences between normal heroic and mythic inside of these guides. The reason for this is I actually have only done these on mythic,
	  thus running them on lower levels for guides would be a waste of my time.</P>
	  <p class="justifier"> With that being said, I hope these written guides are helpful. For any further inquiries feel free to use the email listed in my Nyalotha guide to contact me.</p>
