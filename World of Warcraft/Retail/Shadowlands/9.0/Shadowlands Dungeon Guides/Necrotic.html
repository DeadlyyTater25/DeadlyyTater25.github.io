      <h1> Introduction to: The Necrotic Wake</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> The Second Dungeon in Shadowlands is also located in Bastion. It is not too much more difficult than the previous dungeon.
	  However, the bosses are a little trickier mechanically. So let's get into it.</p>
	  <h1> First Boss: Blightbone </h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> This boss is about add control. Tank should mitigate and eat damage from crunch while dragging the boss out of fetid gas.
	  The boss will target a player every so often with heaving wretch. Other players need to avoid this to avoid dot damage, however, that is not the only threat from this attack.
	  Heaving wretch also spawns 3 carrion worms. These worms need to be CCed and killed before they can land three bites (stacks of gorge) and explode.
	  When they die the worms will drop an AOE puddle that needs to be avoided. That's the fight, and it's likely your group will wipe at least once during this so dont get too frustrated.</p>
	  <h1> Second Boss: Amarth the Harvester</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">This fight is even more of an add fight than Blightbone. Land of the dead will raise a number of adds that must be dealt with, mages first as they cast nast spells.
	  Final Harvest will explode the bodies of the dead adds, so if all adds are dead just avoid them. However, if you left any adds up they will explode for nasty raid damage.
	  Lastly, you want to stay behind the boss to avoid necrotic breath as you focus Amarth down. This is the entire fight so once you get the add mechanic you should have no problems.</p>
	  <h1> Third Boss: Surgeon Stitchflesh</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> Again this is an add fight you will start by killing a bunch of adds until the boss casts awaken creation. You want to be attacking this add until the boss is pulled from his stage.
	  Standard tanking rules apply tank needs to mitigate the big hit ranged need to dodge the goo being thrown at them, and should also be on the side of the room as the goo leaves an AOE puddle.
	  Make sure there is never more than one big add out at a time or you will have a bad day. every so often one player will be targetted with meathook. This is used to pull down Surgeon StichFlesh,
	  and to keep him pulled down. Essentially once successfully pulled down, the player with meathook aimed at them must face it towards him and side step at the last second,
	  keep meathooking and damaging the boss as well as killing any extra adds. That's the fight.</p>
	  <h1> Fourth Boss: Nalthor</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">This fight is pretty straight forward if a little mechanic heavy. Essentially the healer needs to dispell frozen binds once it is safe to do so, that is to say the affected player is alone.
	  During Commet Storm just stay moving, dps his shield down when he casts it, if chosen to be exiled run to the end of the new area dodging swirls and kill the add asap. Aside from that dps the boss.
	  This should almost always be a nice clean victory as long as your team is competent.</p>
