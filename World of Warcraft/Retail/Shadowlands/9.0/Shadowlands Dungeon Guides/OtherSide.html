      <h1> Introduction to: De Other Side</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> This is actually my most hated dungeon simply for the last boss, and this was also the mythic i completed last. It is really difficult,
	  and if your dps is low dont even try. However, for those willing to brave it, this dungeon is the last dungeon in Ardenweald. As such here are the boss mechanics you need to know.</p>
	  <h1> First Boss:  Hakkar</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> this is a standard boss fight with a couple of twists. the main mechanics are that occasionally a few players will get cursed blood they need to move that out.
	  Adds will spawn that when killed drop a pool which shrinks and eventually becomes another add, and you need to pop mitigation and cooldowns before blood barrier casts.
	  Dps his blood barrier away, and interrupt the rest of the attack, and thats the fight.</p>
	  <h1> Second Boss: Manastorms</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">This is a two part boss fight, although it is very easy. The main mechanics are simple, in Phase one, block the crystal beams, line up lazer fingers to stun the boss
	  and dps him down while dodging his wife's attacks. Phase 2 simply use shadowfury on her and defuse squirell bombs, and that's the fight.</p>
	  <h1> Third Boss: Dealer Xy'exa</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> Another easy, yet mechanic heavy, fight Essentially you use traps to dodge explosions, make sure you time these correctly
	  pass around a lightning strike to avoid the debuff it stacks on you causing you to be one shot, and dodge a very obviously telegraphed beam attack.
	  That's the entire fight but it can go south very quickly. </p>
	  <h1> Fourth Boss: Mueh'zala</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> This fight is a pain especially if dps is a bit lacking. Tank mitigates the soulcrusher attack, everyone needs to watch the color of the boss to know which way to dodge,
	  healers should dispel Cosmic artifice as soon as possible, and players affected should pull back and drop their pools where they won't be in the way. During Phase 2 use the portals
	  kill the adds and click the totems to return. Rinse and Repeat to kill the final boss. This sounds easy but it is by far the most annoying nonraid boss in shadowlands.</p>
