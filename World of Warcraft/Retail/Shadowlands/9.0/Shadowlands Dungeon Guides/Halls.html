      <h1> Introduction to: The Halls of Atonement</h1>
	  <p> the first Dungeon in Revendreth and, ironically enough, my first dungeon this expansion. This dungeon does focus a bit more on mechanics than others. However
	  I would rank this as the second easiest.</p>
	  <h1> First Boss: Halkias</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">First boss is simple, watch your feet, avoid red beams of death and stay inside his red circle at all times.
	  Tank should move the boss as needed so the party can easily keep their feet clean. DPS the boss and easy victory.</p>
	  <h1> Second Boss: Echelon</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">During this fight avoid blood torrent and like in Necrotic Wake Surgeon StitchFest range should stick to the side to avoid clogging the floor. Group adds together
	  and kill them (turn them to stone) then use stone shattering leap, or any other method, to get rid of them. at 100 energy the boss casts curse of stone slowing the party
	  and eventually turning them to stone for 8 seconds. This can be dispelled otherwise just be relatively safe when turned to stone. This is the entire fight.
	  Mechanically complicated yes, but it is simple once you learn the mechanics.</p>
	  <h1> Third Boss: High Adjudicator Aleez</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">This is yet again a fairly standard boss fight with one twist. Tank eats Bolt of Power (it can be interrupted but interrupts should be prioritized on other skills), interrupt Volley of Power,
	  avoid pools of anima fountain, and when the boss casts spectral procession the targeted player needs to hide behind a lamp. Aside from that dps the boss and its a sure victory.</p>
	  <h1> Fourth Boss: Lord Chamberlain</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">For Lord Chamberlain the fight is simply if a bit of a slight healer check as well as mechanical awareness.
	  Tank should mitigate the end of stigma of pride supplimented by a healer minor cooldown if necessary, all players should avoid the cone attack and flying statues.
	  When Lord Chamberlain does his chorus dance, avoid the statues as they go in and out, then soak the beams. That is the entire fight.</p>
