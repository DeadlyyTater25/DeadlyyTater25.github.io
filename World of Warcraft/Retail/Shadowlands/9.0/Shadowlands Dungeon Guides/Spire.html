      <h1> Introduction to: The Spire of Ascension</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> The Spire of Ascension is the first dungeon located in Bastion, and it serves as one of the easier dungeons of the expansion.
	  However, that does not mean this dungeon is a cake walk especially on Mythic difficulty. The bosses here, like most of these dungeons, are pretty straight forward.
	  In fact most are only one stage, but without further adeu, let's go over these fights. </p>
	  <h1> First Boss: Kin-Tara and Azules </h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> This boss, despite technically being two enemies, is one of the easiest in all of the dungeons. Any damage done to Kin-Tara will also be done to Azules, 
	  and this in turn mitigates the most dangerous part of the fight enragement. Essentially this fight just consists of watching your feet, moving out if you are targeting by Kin-Tara's spear,
	  and interrupting Dark Lance. Occassionally the tank may need to mitigate as she casts overhead slash, and the party needs to avoid the frontal cone attack by Azulez. Kill one then the other in rapid succession,
	  and move on. Quick and easy fight.
	  <h1> Second Boss: Ventunax </h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> For a second Boss Ventunax, or as some people like to call this fight bullet hell the boss, is actually mechanically simply. Just watch the floor as shadow whirl will spit out bolts
	  "bullets" if you will all over the place that damage and throw you in the air if hit. Every so often Ventunax will teleport to another player leaving a shadow whirl where she was(Dark Stride) the tank should taunt her immediately as she lands.
	  Inaddition all players should dodge blinding flash to avoid being stunned.When she hits 0% energy she will enter recharge, this is where the term bullet hell the boss comes in,
	  during this every shadowwhirl will shoot bolts nonstop for 10 seconds. That is essentially the fight,
	  avoid the bolts of dark magic, watch for the teleport, and damage the boss. Nice and clean victory usually.</p>
	  <h1> Third Boss: Oryphorion </h1>
	  <p class="justifier">This fight is more about dot management and a healer test to be honest. Nobody should be within 8 yards of the tank
	  as the boss will occasionally do a stomp attack leaving a dot on the tank. Purifying blast will occasionally target other players who need to move out to avoid clippy party members.
	  If the targeted player does not have extra defensives the healer will need to give them more heals to withstand the damage from the 8 yard blast and dot damage. The boss will then cast emperial ordinance
	  placing a marker on everyones head, and leaving a pool underneath them after 3 seconds. Players should leave the ring under their feet and the tank needs to get the boss out of the way of these pools.
	  The boss will eventually run out of power and enter a recharge state. At this point the pools will turn to balls of anima which need to be soaked to avoid big raid damage. The boss also takes double damage here,
	  so pop all of your major cooldowns. Rinse and Repeat for a dead robot boss thing.</p>
	  <h1> Fourth Boss: Devos </h1>
	  <p class="justifier">This boss fight has two phases, the first phase is Devos on the ground she will send out lost confidence leaving players with the lingering doubt debuff.
	  healers need to dispell this debuff once they are clear of the lost confidence circle prioritizing melee.
	  When she casts Abyssal Detonation simply get into the archon's bastion bubble to avoid the damage.
	  Ocassionally Devos will use runthrough just side step this attack. Stage two sees Devos fly into the sky leaving behind a spear.
	  Anima balls will spawn which need to be brought to the spear to charge it. Fight against slipstream or backlash winds as well as the dot pools and collect the anima.
	  Once the spear is charged one player will throw it at Devos knocking her from the sky. Do not miss or it's a wipe. Rinse and repeat for a dead betrayer.</p>
