      <h1> Introduction to: The Sanguine Depths</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> The Last Dungeon you will encounter, and the second one in Revendreth. This Dungeon is actually a lot easier than it sounds with a good group.
	  However, I would still rate it as fairly difficult</p>
	  <h1> First Boss: Kryxis</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> The name of the game here is not getting knocked off the edge. Almost all of his attacks have knockback so never be too close to the cliff. Interrupt Hungering Drain,
	  stack up for juggernaut rush to decrease damage, pop bubbles spawned by severing smash, and dps the boss. Nice simple fight as long as you watch your position.</p>
	  <h1> Second Boss: Executor Tarvold</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> This boss is mostly a mechanic check if your group is not coordinated you will not succeed. Castigate will be cast on a random player who needs to take it out,
	  down the add as fast as possible to minimize the size of the blood pool it drops, and to end raid damage, finally dodge the sintouched anima beams.
	  Not a hard boss by nature but by location since it is in a hallway and you constantly must be on the move both from the sides and around the hall to avoid the pools.</p>
	  <h1> Third Boss: Grand Proctor Beryllia</h1>
	  <p class="justifier"> Not a difficult boss at all, but a lesson in sharing. Tank needs to mitigate Iron Spikes, dodge swirls from endless torment,
	  and collect the shiny yellow orbs during right of supremacy. Each player should be able to collect 3, the more you have the less damage you take.
	  However, please make sure to share them with your party to avoid stupid mistakes. That's the fight nice and clean usually.</p>
	  <h1> Fourth Boss: General Kaal</h1>
	  <p class="justifier">Again, a very mechanical boss fight. Dodge the boss's charge attack, watch out for the bands of beams, the tank should of picked up a shield after the previous fight;
	  this is used to avoid the knockback of gloom squall. Do not pop the shield too early, and do not forget to get in the bubble. If you do you will be thrown off the edge.
	  That is the entire fight dps until the boss is captured.</p>
